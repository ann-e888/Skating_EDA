# Skating_EDA
In this project I am creating a dataset with detailed marks received by skater from judges in major skating competitions. I am usisng data from ISU official website where there are international judges to avoid biases that often occur during national competitions (skaters on average achieve higher scores during nationals than any other international competitons).
